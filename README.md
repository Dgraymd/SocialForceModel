# Social Force Model in C++

The *social force model* was originally introduced by [Helbing and Molnár (1995)](https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevE.51.4282), and is one of the microscopic technique in crowd simulation. It presents an idea that the agents’ internal motivation to perform certain movements affects their motion. Throughout the years, many improvements were made to the original model. One of the latest improvement was made by [Moussaïd *et al.* (2009)](https://doi.org/10.1098/rspb.2009.0405). In their research, the model parameters were calibrated to match the results of the experiment they have conducted on the real-world crowd. The *Social Force Model in C++* project  is created based on this research.
